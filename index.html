<h1> Welcome to the future site of the Saxony unoffical forums.</h1>
<h2> A place for residents to chat, exchange grievances, exchange lost packages, and share community knowledge.</h2>
<p> This site was originally launched in response to Richdale's towing of several vehicles illegally in September of 2019. As I understand it, several individuals were able to recover damages, so that's great!  </p>
<em><p> If you are dealing with a similar issue now, know that Texas Occupations Code, Sec. 2308.253 addresses the towing of vehicles from an apartment complex. Provided that you were not parked in a tow-away zone or leaking "a fluid that presents a hazard or threat", there are very few legitimate reasons you can be towed without proper (10 days, properly served) notice. Specifically, the forbids towing for expired tags. I would encourage you to seek counsel if you were towed as a resident, and did not, or are uncertain if you did, receive proper notice. Recovery is in the thousands of dollars.</p></em>
<p>
Since this was a limited-time thing, and I assume all that were going to react have, I figured I would get on with the next iteration of SaxonyRenters.com. I plan to make this a (fairly) unpoliced community forum. I won't be responsible for what is posted, but if I see illegal posts I will delete and ban without question. Other than that, I don't care what you say; if you are a Saxony resident or employee you are welcome. Lovers, haters, haters of me, all will be welcome here. </p>
