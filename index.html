<h1> If you were towed by Saxony, it was probably illegal!</h1>
<h2> Texas Law requires proper notice be delivered prior to an apartment towing</h2>
<p> Specifically, Texas Occupations Code, Sec. 2308.253 addresses the towing of vehicles from an apartment complex. Provided that you were not parked in a tow-away zone or leaking "a fluid that presents a hazard or threat". </p>
<em><p> This section applies only to a parking facility serving or adjacent to an apartment complex consisting of one or more residential apartment units and any adjacent real property serving the apartment complex.</br> Except as provided by a contract described by Subsection (e), a parking facility owner may not have a vehicle towed from the parking facility merely because the vehicle does not display an unexpired license plate or registration insignia issued for the vehicle under Chapter 502, Transportation Code, or the vehicle registration law of another state or country.</br> </br>A contract provision providing for the towing from a parking facility of a vehicle that does not display an unexpired license plate or registration insignia is valid only if the provision requires the owner or operator of the vehicle to be given at least 10 days written notice that the vehicle will be towed from the parking facility at the vehicle owners or operators expense if it is not removed from the parking facility. The notice must:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 10px">(1)
state:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(A)
that the vehicle does not display an unexpired license plate or registration insignia;</br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(B)
that the vehicle will be towed at the expense of the owner or operator of the vehicle if the vehicle does not display an unexpired license plate or registration insignia; and</br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(C)
a telephone number that is answered 24 hours a day to enable the owner or operator of the vehicle to locate the vehicle; and</p>
<p style="text-indent: 10px">be:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(A)
delivered in person to the owner or operator of the vehicle;</br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(B)
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to that owner or operator; or</br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">(C)
attached:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">(i)
to the vehicles front windshield;</br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">(ii)
to the vehicles drivers side window; or</br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">(iii)
if the vehicle has no front windshield or drivers side window, to a conspicuous part of the vehicle.</em>
